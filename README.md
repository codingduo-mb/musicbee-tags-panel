# Tags-Panel Plugin for MusicBee

## Description

This plugin lets you add a number of self-defined tags to a chosen metadata tag field (e.g. Genre, Mood, Keywords). It creates a panel with one or more checkbox lists which are freely placeable.

## Requirements

- MusicBee 3.5.8698 P
- .NET Framework 4.5.2 - should come with Windows Update automatically if you are on Windows 10 or 11

## Installation

Copy the `mb_TagsPanel.dll` file to the MusicBee Plugins directory (usually `C:\Program Files (x86)\MusicBee\Plugins` or `C:\Program Files\MusicBee\Plugins`).
After copying the file, restart MusicBee and the plugin should be installed and ready to use. 

Go to the top right corner of MusicBee and choose "Arrange Panels" and then drag "tags-Panel" to one of the panels or sidebars of your layout.

Please note: Sometimes you have to enable the plugin in MusicBee's "Preferences" window -> Plugins -> Tags-Panel -> Enable.

## Configuration

You will find the settings under Tool->Tags-Panel Settings or by clicking the panels header on the left and selecting settings. 
Here you can edit your tag list, add / remove the plugins tab pages and import and export tags in a comma separated list.

## Usage

After installing the plugin, a new panel will appear in the MusicBee user interface. This panel displays a list of tags for the currently selected music file. The user can add, remove, and change tags by clicking the corresponding checkboxes in the list.

Just select one or more music files in the main window and then click on the checkboxes in the panel to add or remove tags. The changes will be saved automatically.
